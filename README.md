# AI-FOR PREDICITNG-HUMAN--BEHAVIOUR-ON-SOCIALMEDIA
This project focuses on analyzing social media posts to predict sentiment, user engagement, and sarcasm using machine learning. It employs a dataset containing text along with sentiment, engagement, and sarcasm labels. The text is preprocessed through lowercasing, removal of non-alphabetic characters, and stopword filtering. Three separate Logistic Regression models are trained using TF-IDF vectorization: one each for predicting sentiment and engagement (which also use sarcasm as a feature), and a standalone model for sarcasm detection. The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Visualizations such as word clouds, bar plots, and heatmaps provide insights into the data distribution and relationships. Additionally, the system includes a post analysis and recommendation function, which takes any user input, predicts its sentiment, sarcasm, and likelihood of engagement, and gives a clear recommendation on whether the post is suitable for publishing or needs revision. The pipeline is implemented using Python with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and nltk.
